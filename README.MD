# AgenticMesh

AgenticMesh is a powerful JVM-based ecosystem for implementing agent-based distributed systems using standardized protocols like A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol). It provides a robust framework for building intelligent, autonomous agent networks that can communicate and collaborate effectively.

## Overview

AgenticMesh enables the development of sophisticated agent-based systems where multiple autonomous agents work together to solve complex problems. Built primarily for JVM languages (Java, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy), it emphasizes:

- **Protocol-First Design**: Built around A2A and MCP protocols for standardized agent communication
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Support for complex agent interaction patterns and behaviors
- **JVM Language Support**: First-class support for multiple JVM languages
- **Flexible Architecture**: Implementation of various mesh patterns for different use cases
- **Intelligent Agents**: Built-in support for AI/ML model integration through MCP

## Key Features

- **A2A Protocol Integration**: Native support for Agent-to-Agent communication protocol
- **MCP Protocol Support**: Built-in capabilities for Model Context Protocol integration
- **Pattern Templates**: Ready-to-use implementations of common agent mesh patterns
- **Language Agnostic**: Core functionality accessible from any JVM language
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for distributed and cloud-native deployments

## Supported Patterns

AgenticMesh provides implementations for several key architectural patterns:

1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Sequential agent processing chains
2. **Hub-and-Spoke**: Centralized coordination with specialized agents
3. **Decentralized Mesh**: Peer-to-peer agent communication
4. **Event-Driven**: Reactive agent behaviors
5. **Blackboard Pattern**: Shared state and collaborative problem-solving

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Basic understanding of agent-based systems

### Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.agenticmesh</groupId>
    <artifactId>agenticmesh-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Basic Usage

```java
// Initialize an agent mesh
AgenticMesh mesh = AgenticMesh.create()
    .withProtocol(A2AProtocol.getInstance())
    .withProtocol(MCPProtocol.getInstance())
    .build();

// Create and register an agent
Agent agent = mesh.createAgent("ProcessingAgent")
    .withCapability(MCPCapability.class)
    .withHandler(message -> {
        // Agent logic here
    })
    .register();
```
