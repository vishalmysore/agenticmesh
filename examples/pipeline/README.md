# Pipeline Pattern in AgenticMesh

## Overview
The Pipeline Pattern in AgenticMesh represents a sequential chain of autonomous agents where each agent processes data or performs actions in a specific order. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where complex processes can be broken down into discrete, sequential steps with clear data flow between agents.

## Pattern Characteristics

- **Sequential Processing**: Agents process data in a predefined order
- **Data Transformation**: Each agent transforms or enriches the data before passing it to the next agent
- **Protocol-Based Communication**: Uses A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for reliable data transfer
- **Independent Processing**: Each agent operates autonomously within its defined responsibility
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error propagation and recovery mechanisms

## Manufacturing Process Example

This example demonstrates a smart manufacturing process implemented using the AgenticMesh Pipeline Pattern. The pipeline consists of multiple specialized agents working together to manage the complete manufacturing lifecycle.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Raw Materials Agent (Kotlin)**
   - Manages raw material inventory and procurement
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Responsibilities:
     - Inventory management
     - Supplier coordination
     - Stock level optimization
   ```kotlin
   @Component
   class RawMaterialsAgent {
       @A2AFunction
       fun checkInventoryLevels()
       @MCPFunction
       fun requestMaterials()
   }
   ```

2. **Quality Inspection Agent (Java)**
   - Performs automated quality inspection
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Responsibilities:
     - Material inspection
     - Compliance verification
     - Quality data logging

3. **Production Planning Agent (Scala)**
   - Optimizes production schedules
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Key Features:
     - ML-based optimization
     - Resource allocation
     - Demand forecasting

4. **Machine Control Agent (Java)**
   - Controls manufacturing equipment
   - Protocol: A2A
   - Functions:
     - Equipment control
     - Performance monitoring
     - Parameter optimization

5. **Assembly Line Agent (Kotlin)**
   - Manages assembly operations
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Features:
     - Robotic control
     - WIP management
     - Line balancing

6. **Quality Control Agent (Java)**
   - Ensures final product quality
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Responsibilities:
     - Product testing
     - Compliance verification
     - Quality documentation

7. **Packaging Agent (Kotlin)**
   - Manages product packaging
   - Protocol: A2A
   - Functions:
     - Packaging operations
     - Label management
     - Material optimization

8. **Shipping Agent (Scala)**
   - Coordinates product delivery
   - Protocols: A2A, MCP
   - Features:
     - Logistics coordination
     - Route optimization
     - Delivery tracking

### Infrastructure Components

- **MongoDB**: Data persistence for agent states and manufacturing data
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming for inter-agent communication
- **Apache Spark**: Data processing for analytics and optimization

### Key Metrics

Each agent in the pipeline monitors:
- Operations per minute
- Processing efficiency
- Active connections
- Resource utilization

### Communication Flow

1. Raw Materials → Quality Inspection → Production Planning
2. Production Planning → Machine Control → Assembly Line
3. Assembly Line → Quality Control → Packaging
4. Packaging → Shipping → Inventory Control

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Easy to add or modify agents without affecting others
2. **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on load
3. **Observability**: Clear visibility into each processing stage
4. **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and recovery
5. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple JVM languages and protocols

## Best Practices

1. Implement proper error handling at each stage
2. Use appropriate protocols (A2A/MCP) based on agent requirements
3. Monitor agent performance and resource utilization
4. Implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance
5. Maintain clear documentation of agent interfaces

## Getting Started

1. Define your pipeline stages
2. Implement agents using appropriate JVM languages
3. Configure communication protocols
4. Set up infrastructure components
5. Deploy and monitor the pipeline
